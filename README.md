   ```

2. Run all tests:

   ```sh
   npm run test
   ```

3. Run tests in headed mode:

   ```sh
   npm run test:headed
   ```

4. Run tests in debug mode:

   ```sh
   npm run test:debug
   ```

5. Open the Playwright test runner UI:

   ```sh
   npm run test:ui
   ```

6. Run tests without linting:

   ```sh
   npm run test:nolint
   ```

7. Show the Playwright test report:
