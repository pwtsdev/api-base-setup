## Scripts

The `package.json` file includes several scripts to help you run and manage your tests:

- `pretest`: Runs TypeScript compiler without emitting files and lints the code using ESLint.
- `test`: Runs all Playwright tests.
- `test:headed`: Runs all Playwright tests in headed mode.
- `test:debug`: Runs all Playwright tests in debug mode.
- `test:ui`: Opens the Playwright test runner UI.

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Run all tests:

   ```sh
   npm run test
   ```

3. Run tests in headed mode:

   ```sh
   npm run test:headed
   ```

4. Run tests in debug mode:

   ```sh
   npm run test:debug
   ```

5. Open the Playwright test runner UI:

   ```sh
   npm run test:ui
   ```

6. Run tests without linting:

   ```sh
   npm run test:nolint
   ```

7. Show the Playwright test report:
